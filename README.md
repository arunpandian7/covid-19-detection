> ## ⚠️ Experiencing a bug in deploying the App in Heroku. Will Update Soon!!!
## Tech Stack
- PyTorch (DL Model)
- OpenCV 
- Streamlit (Front End)
## Datasets
>😃 I am very grateful and thankful to the huge efforts by the Open-Source Community for collecting data in a repository. This project would be possible without those repositories.
- Cohen's [COVID Chest X-ray Dataset](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset) 
- Paul Mooney's [Chest X-ray Dataset (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
## Training Notebooks
I recommend you to get started with Deep Learning by going through the below notebooks. 
- [Model Training](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ArunRK7Codie/covid-19-detection/blob/master/covid_19_detection.ipynb) 
- [Inference](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ArunRK7Codie/covid-19-detection/blob/master/inference.ipynb)
## Instruction
1) Clone this repository
2) Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements` while opening the terminal in the repo directory.
3) Run the app with `streamlit run app.py`

> ❗Stay at home. Stay Safe. Live Long and Prosper🖖. May the Force be with you.
